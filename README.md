```
Hero vs Villain
```

### In this exercise, you'll be using ES6 classes to create a simple hero vs villain game! The hero and the villain will be able to equip a weapon and start attacking each other. The HTML and CSS should be relatively simple - instead, we want to focus on how we structure our Object Oriented code. Instead of using "var", start getting used to using "let". 

```
Step 1
```

### In a new project, create these files: index.html, script.js, Person.js, Hero.js, Villain.js, Weapon.js. Include all of these script tags in the <head> of your html, making sure script.js is last.

```
Step 2
```

### Implement the Person class in Person.js. A Person should have these characteristics:

* A property "name" which is a string passed in through the constructor
* A property "health" which is hardcoded to 100 initially
* A property "weapon" which is null initially
* A method equipWeapon(weapon), which will take a weapon object and attach it to the "weapon" property
* A method attack(person), which will deduct health from the target based on what weapon this person has equipped

```
Step 3
```

### Implement the Hero class in Hero.js. A Hero should have these characteristics:

* A Hero should be a subclass of Person (hint: use "extends", and don't forget to use super() in the constructor)
* A method render() which will output HTML that represents the Hero
   * You can render a simple <img> tag if you'd like! Find any old "hero" image on google
   * Make sure to show the "health" of the hero too

```
Step 4
```

### Implement the Villain class in Villain.js. A Villain should have these characteristics:

* A Villain should be a subclass of Person (hint: use "extend", and don't forget to use super() in the constructor)
* A method render() which will output HTML that represents the Villain
* You can render a simple <img> tag if you'd like! Find any old "villain" image on google
* Make sure to show the "health" of the villain too

```
Step 5
```

### Implement the Weapon class in Weapon.js. A Weapon should have these characteristics:

* A property called "name", which is a string passed in through the constructor
* A property called "damage", which is a random number between 10 and 20

```
Step 6
```

### Time to tie all of your classes together! script.js is going to control the gameplay itself:

* When the page loads, prompt the user for the name of the Hero and the name of the Villain
* Create a new Hero and a new Villain, render them to the screen
* Create two new Weapons, and have the Hero and Villain each equip one
* Provide two buttons on the screen: one that will let the Hero attack the Villain and another button that will let the Villain attack the Hero
* When the Hero's health goes below 1, show "Game over"
* When the Villain's health goes below 1, show "Victory!"
